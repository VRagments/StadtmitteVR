# Underground - StadtmitteVR

**VR Tour of a Berlin subway station**

In this project, we turned Berlin subway station Stadtmitte into a virtual reality experience. With “Stadtmitte in VR“, we show users how digital data can enhance daily activities: easily finding your way through the concrete jungle, knowing where to buy metro tickets quickly, meeting your friends at the right metro exit. Innovative technologies can guide you through the city and this project shows in how far VR can be utilized for that.

In our VR experience, we included a few gamification aspects and you can pick three different scenarios which will lead to different challenges.

Here you can see some early sketches from our 3D artist Jens Brandenburg. Based on data we received from BVG, we were able to build the metro station for VR.
